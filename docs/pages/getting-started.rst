===============
Getting Started
===============

This documentation will cover some of the basics of the project,
and hopefully put you in a position to run the
experiment and analyze data yourself.

----------------------
Running the Experiment
----------------------

The experiment runs using Psychopy 3.1.

The experiment protocol can be found on Dropbox at
``DJW_Projects/01_MADE/PAPERWORK/MADE_v3_Protocol.gdoc``

The questionnaire is hosted on Qualtrix.
Contact daniel.j.wilson@gmail.com for login information.

Updating Documentation

.. note::

    Keep in mind that if you are using the Read the Docs documentation
    there is always the option to add/edit.

Just look for this image on the top right of the page:

.. image:: ../_static/images/edit_on_github.png
   :width: 250
   :alt: edit on github image

Click on it (which automatically forks it), make your edits
and then create a pull request.
